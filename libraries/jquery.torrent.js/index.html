    <h1>jQuery SuperNode</h1>
    <p>The jQuery SuperNode plugin provides a revolutionary way for developers to scale their applications. jQuery SuperNode works by moving standard load balancing and routing constructs that are normally handled at the server infrastructure level down to the client. In this method, web applications are able to provide a high level of availability and access since it removes a key single point of failure. The plugin uses concepts from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnutella">Gnutella</a> project repackaged for building web applications.</p>
